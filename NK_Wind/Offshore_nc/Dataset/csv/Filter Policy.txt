Data Filter

In Terms of filtering comparison_grid data, there will be two arguments for filtering.

1. Comparison Data must not have duplicate data as candidate data 
(If it does, the data will be omitted in comparison-grid)

2. Since it is mostly for offshore, not onshore, deletion of onshore data will be "must-do"


both ERA5 and NASA CCMP datasets will be done by this filtering
